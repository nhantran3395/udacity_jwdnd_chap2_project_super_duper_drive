approach 1:
	define an error system

	example:
	ERRF001: Failed to store empty file
	ERRF002: Cannot store file with relative path outside current directory
	ERRF00x: Falied to store file <- common

	how to implement?

	Front-end side

	create errors.js

	define error as const
	const ERRF001 = "Failed to store empty file"

	implement util to get error message from error code
	const getErrMsgFromErrCode = (errorCode) => {}

	Back-end side

	modify util setUpQueryParamsForOpeningAlertInCaseOfError to return error code 

	define error code for each exception correspond with errors.js

approach 2 (current):
	pass error message directly as query param -> js read and display on alert

possible exception:
file storage:
1.upload an empty file
2.upload a file exceeded limit
3.download a file that is already removed
