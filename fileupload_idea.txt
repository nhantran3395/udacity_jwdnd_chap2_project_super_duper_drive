*if create unique folder for each user

common:
	folder name format: {userid}_{username}

approach 1:
on registration
	generate a folder for that new user also
		->inject FileUploadStorageService into User Service

on download
	generate regex match {userid}_{username}. then read from folder
		
approach 2:		
on upload file for the 1st time
	when new user upload file for the first time -> generate folder 
		->in FileUploadService, check if there is any files corresponded to id of new user
		->if no: upload file for 1st time -> generate folder
		->if yes: folder is already there -> reconfirm whether folder exist

on download
	generate regex match {userid}_{username}. then read from folder
		
approach 3:		
on user registration, write into table 
	folders (folder_id,user_id,folder_path)
	
	or users (storagefoldername)?
	
	then on upload, verify if folder exists: 
		if not exist -> generate folder -> write file into folder
		if exist -> write file into folder

on download
	get folder name from db. then read from folder
